"""Abstract base class for all BioTrace sensor drivers.

Every sensor driver (real or mock) must inherit ``BaseSensor`` and implement
``start()`` and ``stop()``.  Each subclass additionally declares its own
Qt signal for emitting raw data.

This contract ensures that swapping a mock sensor for a real hardware driver
requires zero changes in the processing or UI layers.

Example::

    class MyHRVSensor(BaseSensor):
        raw_rr_interval_received = pyqtSignal(float, float)  # (rr_ms, timestamp)

        def start(self) -> None:
            self._running = True
            # open serial port, start read thread …

        def stop(self) -> None:
            self._running = False
            # close port, join thread …
